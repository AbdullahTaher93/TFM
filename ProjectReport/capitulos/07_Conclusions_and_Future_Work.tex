\section{Conclusions}
Cryptanalysis is difficult to work that needs a fast and efficient method.GA is an efficient search method to find the best decryption key. The GA has a special performing in cryptanalysis because GA is used for searching.key and the key has the main condition that not repeated any element in the same key.
In the following points, the main issues that were concluded from the
implementation of the project are given:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Genetic algorithm used in the cryptanalysis a good decision because The GAs better algorithm in searching for a solution.}
    \item {In the crossover, the operation used a proposed method because of the key generated as the main condition that each element has only one occurrence in each key.}
    \item { Evaluating fitness depending on the terms unigram Bigram and Trigram in each plaintext after a transposition cipher is implemented.}
    \item {All tests of the proposed work obtained the decryption key in the early rounds caused a good proposal for cryptanalysis.}

\end{enumerate}
