# Cryptanalysis Ciphertext Based Genetic Algorithms

## ABSTRACT  
Cryptanalysis is breaking the ciphertext(codes) to find the
plaintext (original text) .There are many tools used in the cryptanalysis.Genetic algorithm(GA).Is an optimization search
tool to find the best solution.In this project ,Genetic algorithm(GA) used as a cryptanalysis tool to search the decryption key for obtaining the plaintext from the ciphertext.When the ciphertext generated by the transpositioncipher.

## Introduction
Cryptanalysis is the technique of deriving the original message from the cipher text without any prior knowledge of secret key or the erivation of key from the cipher text. A general technique for cryptanalysis, applied to all cryptographic algos is to try all the possible keys until the correct key is matched, it is known as exhaustive key search. 

A symmetric key cipher, especially a stream cipher is assumed secure, if the computational capability required for breaking the cipher by best-known attack is greater than or equal to exhaustive key search. 
Cryptanalysis is the science of making encrypted data unencrypted use convert cipher text to plaintext because cryptanalysis used to convert plaintext to cipher text and used cryptanalysis Return to plaintext or clear text or original text cryptanalysis is used to break codes by finding weaknesses. There are many techniques used in the cryptanalysis. This project used the genetics algorithm.

The genetic algorithm is a search algorithm based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics The genetic algorithm belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms, along with genetic programming, Evolution strategies and evolutionary programming. The set of operators usually consists of mutation, crossover and selection,

Cryptanalysis is the technique of extracting useful information about the key by observing the plaintext and cipher text using cryptanalysis   try to break the secrecy provided by the cipher. There is no fixed method for cryptanalysis and every cipher is a different challenge to the attacker and hence demands different insight to attack  In this chapter, explained the history of cryptanalysis, the technology of cryptanalysis, transposition cipher, and description genetics algorithm (GA).

## Cryptanalysis
Cryptanalysis are the basic techniques on block cipher and till today, many cryptanalytic attacks are developed based on these. The cryptanalysis return cipher text to clear text  (or original text) by different methods to find the decryption  key, in other words, cryptanalysis is a method to reveal the key by the Receiver to transform cipher text to plaintext (or original text)
